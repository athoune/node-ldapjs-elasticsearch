# Node ldap elasticsearch

Convert ldap query (from [ldapjs](http://ldpajs.org) project) to
[elastic search](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) query. With few code, you
create a ldap server wich ask question to your elastic search index.

Imagine querying from your mail client to your intranet data stored in a classic storage (mysql, mongodb â€¦)

## What you can do

 * no authentification for now

 * no equivalent for \>= and \<=

## Install and test
